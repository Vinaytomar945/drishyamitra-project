# DrishyaMitra – AI Photo Management System

DrishyaMitra is an AI-powered photo management platform that allows users to upload images and automatically analyze facial attributes such as **age, gender, and emotion** using deep learning models.

The system is built using a **modern full-stack architecture** with containerized deployment using Docker and secure access through Nginx with SSL.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Upload photos through a modern React interface
* AI-powered facial analysis using **DeepFace**
* Automatic detection of:

  * Age
  * Gender
  * Emotion
* Face embedding generation for similarity matching
* Secure HTTPS access via **Nginx Reverse Proxy**
* Containerized deployment with **Docker & Docker Compose**
* Photo gallery with AI metadata
* Scalable backend architecture

---

## 🧠 AI Capabilities

The platform uses **DeepFace**, a deep learning-based facial analysis framework.

AI analysis includes:

* Face detection
* Age estimation
* Gender prediction
* Emotion recognition
* Face embedding generation for similarity detection
